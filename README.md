## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: Final presentation and reporting
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Initial Assessment
- Import raw sales data from various sources
- Assess data quality and identify issues
- Document data sources and structure

### 2. Data Cleaning (Excel)
**Location**: `excel-analysis/data-cleaning.xlsx`

**Key activities**:
- Remove duplicate records
- Handle missing values and null entries
- Standardize data formats (dates, currencies, categories)
- Validate data integrity and consistency
- Create data quality reports

**Excel techniques used**:
- VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP for data matching
- Conditional formatting for outlier detection
- Data validation rules
- Pivot tables for initial exploration

### 3. Data Preprocessing (Excel)
**Location**: `excel-analysis/preprocessing.xlsx`

**Key activities**:
- Create calculated fields and derived metrics
- Aggregate data by time periods, regions, and products
- Normalize and standardize numerical values
- Create categorical groupings
- Generate summary statistics

**New metrics created**:
- Revenue growth rates
- Customer lifetime value
- Product performance indices
- Seasonal adjustment factors

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
**Location**: `tableau-visualizations/sales-dashboard.twbx`

**Dashboards created**:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs and trends
- **Sales Performance**: Revenue, units sold, and growth metrics
- **Product Analysis**: Best/worst performers and category insights
- **Geographic Analysis**: Regional sales distribution and performance
- **Time Series Analysis**: Seasonal trends and forecasting
- **Customer Segmentation**: Customer behavior and value analysis

**Key visualizations**:
- Interactive sales trend lines
- Geographic heat maps
- Product performance bar charts
- Customer segment scatter plots
- Seasonal decomposition charts

### 5. Presentation & Reporting (PowerPoint)
**Location**: `presentation/sales-analysis.pptx`

**Presentation structure**:
1. Executive Summary
2. Methodology & Data Sources
3. Key Findings & Insights
4. Performance Metrics
5. Recommendations
6. Next Steps & Action Items

## Key Findings

### Sales Performance
- Overall revenue trends and growth patterns
- Top performing products and categories
- Underperforming areas requiring attention

### Customer Insights
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Purchase behavior patterns
- Customer retention and acquisition metrics

### Market Trends
- Seasonal sales patterns
- Geographic performance variations
- Emerging market opportunities

## Data Sources
- **Primary**: Sales transaction database
- **Secondary**: Customer demographics, product catalogs
- **External**: Market research data, economic indicators

## Requirements

### Software Requirements
- Microsoft Excel 2016 or later
- Tableau Desktop (latest version recommended)
- Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 or later

### Data Requirements
- Sales transaction data (minimum 12 months)
- Product information and categories
- Customer demographics (if available)
- Geographic/regional data

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-analysis-project.git
cd sales-analysis-project
```

### 2. Data Setup
1. Place raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory
2. Update data source connections in Excel files
3. Verify data formats match expected structure

### 3. Excel Analysis
1. Open `excel-analysis/data-cleaning.xlsx`
2. Update data source references
3. Run cleaning procedures
4. Proceed to `preprocessing.xlsx` for additional transformations

### 4. Tableau Visualization
1. Open `tableau-visualizations/sales-dashboard.twbx`
2. Update data connections to point to processed Excel files
3. Refresh data extracts
4. Customize visualizations as needed

### 5. Generate Presentation
1. Export charts from Tableau as images
2. Update PowerPoint presentation with latest visuals
3. Customize findings and recommendations based on results

## Usage Guidelines

### Data Updates
- Monthly refresh recommended for ongoing analysis
- Update data connections in Excel before refreshing Tableau
- Archive previous versions before major updates

### Customization
- Modify Excel formulas for different business rules
- Adjust Tableau filters and parameters for specific analysis needs
- Update presentation template for different audiences

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-analysis`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -am 'Add new analysis feature'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/new-analysis`)
5. Create a Pull Request

## Best Practices
- Document all data transformations and assumptions
- Use consistent naming conventions across all files
- Validate results with business stakeholders
- Maintain version control for all analysis files
- Regular backup of work in progress

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Excel file corruption**: Keep backup copies and use auto-save
- **Tableau connection errors**: Verify file paths and data source permissions
- **Performance issues**: Consider data sampling for large datasets

### Data Quality Issues
- Missing values: Document handling approach in methodology
- Outliers: Investigate and validate before removal
- Inconsistent formats: Create standardization rules
